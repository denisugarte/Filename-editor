# Filename-editor
This desktop multiplatform application is able to rename files in the local disk. There are two options:
  - Rename all files in a directory adding a custom prefix.
  - Rename all files in a directory adding a custom prefix and a name structure. All files will have an incremental number in the end. Example: prefix_capture_1, prefix_capture_2, prefix_capture_3...
